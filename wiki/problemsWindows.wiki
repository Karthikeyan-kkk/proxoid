#summary Problems resolution on windows

Some peoples report trouble when trying to install on windows.<br/>

The trouble that occur more often is that Windows doesn't ask for any driver.<br/>
Instead it installs automatically I a usb mass storage device<br/>

Here is How to do in this case :<br>
 * plug the phone
 * select mount on the phone
 * wait 20 seconds then select "turn off usb device" on the phone
 * then go to My computer,  Right click on properties and go to hardware then device manager. 
 * The yellow warning should be up with android phone displayed. Right click on it and select Update driver. Install the downloaded driver. (Look at [installationWindowsVista Vista installation] from step 3.2 ...)
