Note :<br/>
In the following documentation, screenshots are in french.<br/>

== Step 1 : Download drivers ==

The real Android SDK is near 200Mb.<br/>
If you're not a developper, most of it will be unused.<br/>
So I made a subset of it that is juste 2Mb and contains adb and the windows driver.

Download it here :<br/>
for 32 bits : http://www.baroukh.com/proxoid/proxoid-adb.zip<br/>
for 64 bits : http://www.baroukh.com/proxoid/proxoid-adb64.zip<br/>
and save it on your disk.<br/>
(if you don't know witch one, try 32bits first ...)

== Step 2 : Extract drivers ==

Right click on the file an choose "Extract all"
Click Next then Next and Finish.
There should be now a directory named "proxoid-adb".

== Step 3 : Install drivers ==

=== Step 3.1 ===
Plug your phone now.<br/>
Windows will work and ask you to use windows update to install drivers :<br/>

Windows will ask you to reboot<br/>
For me, itwas not necessary.<br/>
Do here as you want...<br/>

=== Step 3.7 ===

We will now verify that all works.<br/>
Your phone should be plugged.<br/>
Browse to proxy-adb directory and execute "check.bat".<br/>
You should see something like 
{{{
List of devices attached
HT848GZ40121    device
}}}

The device number can be different.<br/>
What is important is that there is something after "List of devices attached".

If yes, you make the harder.<br/>
If not, drop me a mail (mike_at_baroukh.com). I'll try to help you. If you can, provide me a screenshot.<br/>

== Step 4 : Configure browser ==

We have to configure the proxy on your browser.
If you already know how to do, go directly to step 5 after ahving configured your browser with proxy "localhost" on port "8080".

=== If you're using Internet Explorer ===

Launch your browser.<br/>
Select menu "Tools" then "Internet Options"<br/>
Go to "network" tab<br/>
Click on "Network parameters"<br/>
Check "Use a proxy server".<br/>
Enter "localhost" for server and 8080 for port.<br/>

Click Ok.<br/>

== Step 6 : Start Proxoid ==

On your phone, run Proxoid and check "Start Proxoid".<br/>

If I'm not wrong, you actually can browse using your phone. <br/>
