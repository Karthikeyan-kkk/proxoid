Note :<br/>
In the following documentation, screenshots are in french.<br/>

== Step 1 : Download drivers ==

The real Android SDK is near 200Mb.<br/>
If you're not a developper, most of it will be unused.<br/>
So I made a subset of it that is juste 2Mb and contains adb and the windows driver.

Download it here :
http://www.baroukh.com/proxoid/proxoid-adb.zip
and save it on your disk.

== Step 2 : Extract drivers ==

Right click on the file an choose "Extract all"
Click Next then Next and Finish.
There should be now a directory named "proxoid-adb".

== Step 3 : Install drivers ==

=== Step 3.1 ===
Plug your phone now.<br/>
Windows will work and ask you to use windows update to install drivers :<br/>

=== Step 3.2 ===

Then, click Next.<br/>

=== Step 3.7 ===

We will now verify that all works.<br/>
Your phone should be plugged.<br/>
Browse to proxy-adb directory and execute "check.bat".<bt/>
You should see something like 
{{{
List of devices attached
HT848GZ40121    device
}}}

The device number can be different.<br/>
What is important is that there is something after "List of devices attached".
