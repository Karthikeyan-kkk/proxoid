#This page describes how to use Proxoid with Linux.
= Installation on Linux =
The guide below describes how to install and use proxoid with Linux. This guide has been tested with Ubuntu 9.04.
== Step 0 : Download and install Proxoid on your phone==
See [http://code.google.com/p/proxoid/wiki/installationPhone this page] for instructions.
== Step 1 : Configure udev to recognize your phone ==
First, plug in your Android phone _via_ usb. Then, create a file 
{{{
/etc/udev/rules.d/11-android.rules 
}}}
containing the two lines 
{{{
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0bb4", SYSFS{idProduct}=="0c02", MODE="0666", OWNER="yourusername" 
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0bb4", SYSFS{idProduct}=="0c01", MODE="0666", OWNER="yourusername" 
}}}
Here, you have to replace yourusename by your user name. 
As you can see, I have two entries in this files for only one phone. This is because once, when I tried to use fastboot, it seems that the idProduct changed. 
To check the idProduct and idVendor stings by issue the command 
{{{
lsusb
}}}
Mine returns
{{{
...
Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0bb4:0c02 High Tech Computer Corp.
...
}}}
Then, restart udev by issuing the command 
{{{
sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart
}}}
== Step 2 : Download SDK ==
Download the Android SDK 1.5_r1 from [http://developer.android.com/intl/fr/sdk/index.html here].
Extract the file 
{{{
unzip <downloadfile.zip>
}}}
== Step 3 : Tunneling ==
Now, we can start tunneling betwwen your computer and your phone.
Change directory to the tools subdirectory of the extracted Android SDK directory. Issue the command
{{{
./adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080
}}}
== Step 3 : configure your browser ==
Your browser must use the proxy server running at localhost:8080.
=== Firefox === 
In firefox, go to Tools->Options->Advanced->Network->Settings. Here, enter the settings shown in the image below

Finally, untick the work offline check button in the file menu.
=== (Planned) Epiphany ===
== Step 4 : Run proxoid on your phone ==
Finally, run Proxoid on your Android phone, click "Start" and start browsing ... 
= Advanced topics =
== Using Proxoid system-wide (Gnome only so far, Untested) ==
Start network preferences by running
{{{
gnome-network-preferences
}}}
or
{{{
gnome-network-properties
}}}
Click *Manual Proxy Configuration* and check *Use the same proxy for all protocols*. Then fill out
   * HTTP Proxy: 
     localhost Port: 8080
Finally, click the button *Apply System-wide*.
== Configure Evolution (Untested) ==
To use Evolution with Proxoid, go to Edit->Preferences->Network Preferences. Fill out the fields
   * HTTP Proxy: 
     localhost Port: 8080
   * Secure HTTP Proxy: 
     localhost Port: 8080
   * SOCKS Proxy: 
     localhost Port: 8080
== Configure SSH ==
To use SSH with proxoid, you need to download the latest version of [http://www.agroman.net/corkscrew/ corkscrew], a tool for tunneling SSH through HTTP proxies. Unpack the archive, change to the directory and compile the program
{{{
./configure
make
sudo make install
}}}
To use SSH through proxoid, add the following line to your ~/.ssh/config file
{{{
ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/corkscrew localhost 8080 %h %p 
}}}
If you keep beeing logged out from the server, add the following line to the /etc/ssh/ssh_config file
{{{
ServerAliveInterval = 2
}}}
= Troubleshooting =
To check whether the device is recogniced properly by adb, try issuing the command (from the tools dir of the android SDK)
{{{
./adb devices
}}}
This should give you output of the form
{{{
* daemon not running. starting it now *
* daemon started successfully *
List of devices attached 
HTXXNKFXXXXX    device
}}}
If your devices is still not found, try to reboot (power off/power on) your computer with the phone plugged in via usb.
