I'l try to descirbe how to do better later, but, for now, here is a brief howto :

== Step 1 : Configure udev to recognize your phone ==

On my computer, I have in /etc/udev/rules.da file named 11-android.rules that contains

SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0bb4", SYSFS{idProduct}=="0c02", MODE="0666", OWNER="mike"
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="0bb4", SYSFS{idProduct}=="0c01", MODE="0666", OWNER="mike"

As you can see, I have two entries in this files for only one phone.
This is because once, when I tried to use fastboot, it seems that the idProduct changed.


== Step 2 : SDK ==

Download and extract sdk from http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r1/index.html

== Step 3 : Tunneling ==

Now, we can start tunneling betwwen your computer and your phone.
cd to the extracted sdk dir.
go to tools subdirectory.
run
./adb forward tcp:8080 tcp:8080

== Step 3 : configure your browser ==

Your browser must use localhost:8080

Finally, run Proxoid, touch "Start" and start browsing ...
